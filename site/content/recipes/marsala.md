- 4 - Chicken breasts

- 4 oz - Unsalted Butter
- 1 - Large onion

Multiply as needed.

## Directions

1. Salt and pepper the chicken breasts
1. Dice the onions
1. Add some of the butter to a pot and brown the chicken (you may need to do this in batches)
1. Remove the browned chicken and set aside
1. Add the remainder of the butter and heat until the butter browns
1. Add the onions until partially cooked
1. Return the chicken to the pot
1. Add the sherry, and enoough water to cover
1. Boil for about 30 minutes, then simmer for another hour

## Serving suggestions

This dish goes well with rice, green vegetables and roasted root vegetables.  
When roasting vegetables you can skim the clarified butter from the marsala
sauce (best done once cooled) for an extra decadent meal.

The onion and sherry can be doubled to make more sauce, with ~50% more butter.
